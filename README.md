# XenomorphsVsColonists
This game prototypes an idea I had for a competive asymetrical round based strategy game. One player controls the colonists and the other player controls an alien. At the beginning the colonist player has to build a base which will be the level you play in for the rest of the game. Depending on the rooms they choose to build they get different units and abilities, but build costs resources and there is only a fixed amount of that in each level. When they have finished building the base the game switches to a round-based combat system. The first player that kills all units of the other player wins the game.

Because this is a prototype I chose a hot-seat like gameplay. In a real game there would be an online mode.
